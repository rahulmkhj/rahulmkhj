- Love writing code, currently working on [Latlog](https://github.com/rahulmkhj/latlog) and [NOG Management System](https://github.com/rahulmkhj/nogms) - need another pair of hands, please consider contributing.
- A litle involved with PCs of various NOG community events like: [INNOG](https://innog.net/), [SANOG](https://sanog.org/) & [APNIC Confs](https://www.apnic.net/events/conferences/) etc.
- Trying to turn writing into a habit. Here's my latest blog post:
  - [Barriers in IPv6 Deployment](https://thebinary.blog/blog/barriers-in-ipv6-deployment/)
